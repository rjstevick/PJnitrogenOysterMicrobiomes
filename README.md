*Study of farmed oysters and nitrogen cycling in Point Judith Pond, RI. Scripts for analysis of 16S rRNA amplicon and metatranscriptomic data for microbial function.*

This repository contains the scripts, pre-processed sequencing data, and the R script files to reproduce the figures in the manuscript. The raw sequences generated for this study can be found in the NCBI Short Read Archive under BioProject no. PRJNA599137. The corresponding accession numbers for each sample are detailed in [`PRJNA599137_NCBI_info.xlsx`](/PRJNA599137_NCBI_info.xlsx). This file also includes file names and environmental data for each 16S rRNA amplicon or metatranscriptomic sample.
